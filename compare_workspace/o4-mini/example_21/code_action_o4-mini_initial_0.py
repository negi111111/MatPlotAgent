It looks like your query is empty—could you please provide the details of what you’d like plotted (e.g. data source or synthetic data, chart type, axes, any specific styling)? Once I have that information, I can generate the required Python/Matplotlib code and save it as “novice.png.”
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.savefig('novice.png')
